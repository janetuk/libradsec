Libradsec is a RADIUS library for clients doing RADIUS over UDP or
TLS. The goal is to add support for writing servers (and thus proxies)
and to add transports TCP and DTLS.


The canonical pickup point is

The source code is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license. See the
LICENSE file.


Libradsec depends on 
- libconfuse
- libevent2
- openssl (if configured with --enable-tls)


To compile the library and the examples, do something like

  sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make


There are a couple of options that can be used when configuring. See

  ./configure --help

for the full list. Worth mentioning here is --enable-tls and
--enable-tls-psk.

If the preprocessor has a hard time finding some of the header files
are, try setting environment variable CPPFLAGS at configure
time. Example:

  CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" ./configure --enable-tls

If the link editor has trouble finding any of the libraries needed,
try setting environment variable LDFLAGS at configure time. Example:

  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --enable-tls


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Debian) with libconfuse (2.7), libevent (2.0.19) and OpenSSL
(1.0.1c).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
